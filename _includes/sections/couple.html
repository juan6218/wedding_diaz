    <h2>Juan and Jackie</h2>
    <p>Jackie, originally from Coachella, CA, and Juan, originally from San Bernardino, met at CSUSB 
      while they were pursuing their majors in Computer Engineering and Kinesiology.</p>
      <p>Mera (Jackies Big Sis) was acutally the on who started it all. She introduced them with the good ol' "Haaaave you met..." line. 
        (If you don't know what that is you really need to watch How I Met Your Mother, great show!)</p>
